Scenario is build from two items, image and .lua.

To isntall scenario you need to do this steps:
  1. Download scenario( .jpg + .lua)
  2. Open your BAR install directory ( usally it's C:\Users\%YOUR_USER%\AppData\Local\Programs\Beyond-All-Reason where you replace %YOUR_USER% ith your actual user.
  3. Then go \data\LuaMenu\configs\gameConfig\byar\scenarios if you don't have any of these folders, create them carefully. Their names are case sensitive
  4. Finally just drop downloaded files there.
  5. Close BAR if running, then start it again( when BAR is runninf it won't refresh data)

If it don't run, crashes, or you have any questions ask them on discord or ping me. You can always ask them on github. Also, if problem occur look at infolog.txt, it can have valuable informations ( in Beyond-All-Reason\data)
